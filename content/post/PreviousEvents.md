# Previous Events

Despite changing the name, this workshop represents the second edition of the [MADTECC (Medical Applications with Digital Twins and Edge-Cloud Continuum)](https://madtecc.github.io) workshop, following its debut at PerCom 2024. This year, we aim to broaden the scope of the topics, keeping the spirit of involving researchers working in practical applications of Digital Twins to complex ecosystems without the constraints on the specific domain of healthcare.
