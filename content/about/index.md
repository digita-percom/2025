# [The 23nd International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (PerCom 2025)](https://www.percom.org/)
## March 17 – 21, 2025, Washington DC, USA (Walter E. Washington Convention Center)

### Conference Overview

IEEE PerCom, now in its 23rd year, will be held at Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington DC, USA, from March 17 – 21, 2025, as a physical in-person conference. PerCom is the premier annual scholarly venue in pervasive computing and communications. Pervasive computing is constantly at the forefront of mobile systems research and has found its way into many commercial systems due to tremendous advances in a broad spectrum of technologies and topics such as wireless networking, mobile and distributed computing, sensor systems, ambient intelligence, and smart devices.

IEEE Percom 2025 will be held in person. Remote presentations and pre-recorded videos are not allowed unless all authors of an accepted paper are under special circumstances that prevent them from attending the conference in person. Requests for such exceptions will be considered carefully by the organizing committees. We are sympathetic to concerns and sentiments about our in-person focus. We will fully accommodate remote authors/speakers if they have Visa-related travel issues or COVID/health-related travel issues.
